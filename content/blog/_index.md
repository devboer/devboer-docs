## Writing Corner

I  will start with writing about setting up my new all-in-one home server for 2026 until further notice. 
- **NAS**: It will be our home's secondary to iCloud for backing up Apple devices. Storage of our files.
- **Media**: At its core, it will serve up media and work autonomously to curate and acquire more media.
- **Homelab**: It can afterall be a virtual playground too. I am excited to try new software and environments.

I might vent here too. Overall, I'll write about anything within the scope of tech news, personal mistakes, etc.
