## The Wiring Struggle

Wiring this build has been a tedious exercise in patience. Between constant second-guessing and severe space constraints—particularly the tight gap between the PSU and the first hard drive bay—every millimeter mattered.

### Layered Protection

I used a dual-layer taping method for the ATX cable run:

* **Base Layer:** Super88 electrical tape to protect against sharp solder spikes.
* **Top Layer:** Kapton heat tape, rated for 400–500°F, providing a secondary thermal barrier over the Super88 (which is rated for ~200°F).

### Rerouting and Refinement

Initially, I tried to utilize every bit of negative space, but it backfired. The CPU power cable bunched up near the USB 3.0 and panel headers, creating enough pressure that I worried it might lift the motherboard.

I went back to the drawing board and rerouted ATX cable to be straigthened and flatter with a direct path from the case wall to the PSU sidewall. This kept the wires from bunching underneath the board and restored the flexibility needed at the PSU connection point. The CPU cable now hugs the case wall and tucks neatly under the storage mounts instead of forcing it the ATX cable route.

### Chassis Fans Cabling

I swapped the stock fans for **Noctuas**, which significantly quieted the build and simplified the cable management. I moved away from chunky PATA connectors to 4-pin PWM fans, using Y-splitters to consolidate four fans into the two motherboard headers.

### SATA Cabling

- **SATA Data:** Routed cleanly, though I’m monitoring them to ensure they don't impede airflow.
- **SATA Power:** I am using the PSU included Type4 to 4 SATA female splitter. The first 3 power the first storage rack with the 4th used with a Y-splitter to power the last two storage racks.

> 
> Shortly after finishing the wiring, I hit a major roadblock: the motherboard turned out to be physically incompatible with the CPU’s iGPU capabilities.
> After a "spirited" dispute with the eBay seller, eBay eventually stepped in to resolve the case in my favor. It was a frustrating detour, but the board has been returned, and I'm sourcing a compatible replacement.
