## Recovery & Build Phases

### The Build Log: Trials, Tribulations, and ZFS Ambitions

Building a PC is rarely a straight line; for me, it’s been a series of “one step forward, two steps back.” Driven by a mix of caffeine-fueled excitement and a touch of disorganized chaos, I’ve seated this motherboard three times now—and I’m still not quite done.

### The Learning Curve
The first attempt was a classic mistake: I secured the board only to realize the **I/O shield** was still sitting on the table. After a brief struggle with those stubborn metal tabs, I finally coaxed it into place. 

The second time I pulled the board, it was a matter of stability. I’d finally dug into the accessories box and realized I was missing a crucial **standoff** to support the corner of the board. But the real heart-attack moment came from the **USB 3.0 front I/O connector**. Every time I unplugged it, the plastic header housing pulled clean off the motherboard, leaving the pins exposed. By some miracle, I haven’t bent a single pin yet.

### The Current Standoff
Round three was undone by my own perfectionism. I seated the board, looked at the **cable management**, and simply wasn’t thrilled. Right now, the build sits idle as I wait for the mail. 

I’m taking a “safety first” approach for the final install. Once the **Super 88 electrical tape** and **Kapton tape** arrive, I’m going to flatten the cables and pin them down. My goal is to protect the wiring from solder spikes and heat, ensuring there’s zero risk of a short or board failure.

### The Storage Strategy
While waiting for the tape to arrive, I’ve completely overhauled my storage architecture. I’ve decided to move away from OS redundancy in favor of specialized performance pools.

**The Drive Lineup:**
* **OS Drive (512GB SSD):** Scavenged from another machine, this will host **Proxmox**, my ISO library, and container templates.
* **Performance Pool (NVMe):** A dedicated ZFS pool reserved strictly for **VMs, Containers, and Cache**.
* **Mass Storage (HDD):** Two 16TB drives and one 4TB drives are on the way from Amazon. 20TB usable pool of storage. 

**The Data Migration Plan:**
1.  Initialize a new **16TB ZFS pool**.
2.  Transfer data from the current 4TB drive to the new 16TB pool.
3.  Format the 4TB drive and marry it to a second 4TB drive for a secondary pool, or investigate joining them into the main data pool.
4. I will connect a spare 2TB holding the VM configs and logical drives ready to import. 

The hardware might be putting up a fight, but the vision for the ultimate home lab is finally coming together.
