## Fighting temptations

It is so easy to think buying more storage space will ease my growing pains. I am running out of space since trying out Usenet and the Arr media automation suite. The automation aspect is new to me when I am familiar with hand picking a torrent. 

I need to first try a few things before expanding my storage resources.
- tdarr: standardize my library
- autopurge: set rules to automate pruning my library. 
    - daily shows like Late Night with Seth Meyers needs a “if watched, delete” or “if older than 7 days, delete”
    - documentaries, musicals, comic specials… that delete after marked watched 
    - capabilities of excluding explicit content eg a documentary I want to rewatch 
    - able to hold polls for regular libraries for deletion, triggered manually or based on data “age of file and or numbers of playback”
- set better sonarr, radarr rules for its automated searches.  


A draft…
