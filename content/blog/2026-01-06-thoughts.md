The wiring has been tedious, worrisome from doubt, and complicated due to space constraints.

The picture doesn’t say it all unfortunately. The cover image has the Super88 electrical tape and kapton heat tape covering. First layer is for protection from solder spikes and second layer is for heat up to 400 - 500 F while first layer is around 200 F. Also about the picture, I changed my mind on the CPU PSU cable. The corner by the USB3 and Panel headers… it bunched and have no idea if there is pressure to lift motherboard there. I imagine there is and might have to go back to the drawing board.

Once I started adding in the PATA and SATA power cables it was getting crazy. There is not much space in between PSU and hard drive bay 1.

I went back to the drawing board. I redid the tape down of the motherboard cabling and forgot to document it. I straightened it out and routed it from case wall near its final connection to PSU sidewall. This route avoided it bunching up underneath board. The idea before was meant to use all negative space best i can, but that sacrificed flexibility at the PSU endpoint. 

This worked out better. 

CPU cable hugged the case wall and edge of motherboard then tunneled under the storage mounts. 

Upgraded the case fans to Noctuas from an Amazon review recommendation. This upgrade made for a silent build and slimmed down cabling from chunky PATA to the PWN 4-pin and rhen grouped to two y splitters to connect the 4 fans tk the two PWN 4-pins on board. These wires were tied down under the two mounts used for storage. 

The SATA data cables were routed cleanly and at first it impeded the fans… maybe more improvement needed? The SATA power cabling is pending an upgrade on Thursday Jan 15. Most of cabling done Monday Jan 12. The Y splitter wasn’t long enough to avoid using my second type 4 PSU cable with 2 PATA and 2 SATA. My main SATA PSU cable has 4 SATAs. 3 of 4 reach the first storage mount. I want to use that 4th to Y split to the last two drives. 


**Update:** I have to redo this because I found out later the motherboard is incompatible with the CPU’s iGPU capabilities. Physically cannot support the CPU’s iGPU. 

I returned it to eBay after “fighting” with the seller. Maybe that’d be good to share here? It ended with eBay resolving the return case.
