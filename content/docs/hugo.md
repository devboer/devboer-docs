# Hugo

This wasn't a fun experience. I don't know 100% what I am because I could burnt out... I want a more complicated theme, but PaperMod and paper can do!

I at least figured out github, github actions, and cloudflare pointing to github pages even with the help of a guide that left out some nuances.

Nuance 1, I had to point this blog or docs site to blog.gh-pages-ip as A records and CNAME record to docs because it had to be different.
Nuance 2, that isn't a nuance, I'd think. CNAME file required to be in github repo root folder.

Alright, well, editing ought to be better outside of vim. Test post sorta.
