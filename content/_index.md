# Hi, I’m Austin (aka devboer),

I learned front-end web development at Kenzie Academy, but I’ll be honest—while I can wrangle CSS when I need to, it’s not my favorite part. My real enjoyment comes from coding logic, solving tricky problems, and making things work under the hood.

Over time, I’ve expanded into self-hosting services on Proxmox since 2022 by building a homelab where I can experiment, and host services for my family. My love for tinkering started before self-hosting when I became the family’s unofficial IT support specialist, and it taught me how to communicate solutions clearly to normies.

This site documents my learning journey—what I’ve built, what I’ve learned, and the challenges I’ve tackled along the way.
