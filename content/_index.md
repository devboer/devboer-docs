# Hi, I’m Austin (aka devboer). 

I learned front-end web development at Kenzie Academy, but I’ll be honest—while I can wrangle CSS when I need to, it’s not my favorite part. My real enjoyment comes from coding logic, solving tricky problems, and making things work under the hood.

Over time, I’ve expanded into self-hosting services on Proxmox, building a homelab where I can experiment, break things, and fix them again. That hands-on tinkering started years ago when I became the family’s unofficial IT support, and it taught me how to communicate solutions clearly while actually getting stuff done.

This site documents my learning journey—what I’ve built, what I’ve learned, and the challenges I’ve tackled along the way.
